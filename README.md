So this is why all the fuss started!
I've uploaded some of the scripts from this class, which was taken in Fall 2021, if that helps clarify why I have a basic knowledge and understanding regarding uncertainty analysis. 
Also, please run the codes in Google Collab (https://colab.research.google.com/) 
I have not run them here. 
From the information I've read, USACE runs R for rivers, geomorphology, etc., and Matlab for Coastal. From recent workshops this year, NWS for coastal uses Python and, very likely, other languages, but this is as far as I know. 
Uncertainty analysis covers a wider realm than dam safety and coastal design. Statistics and probability are applied to various disciplines, including engineering, physics, biology, meteorology, astronomy, social sciences, and others.
I hope you have fun with these. Homework 6 was the most entertaining; one of the tasks was mapping stars. (Very visual)
